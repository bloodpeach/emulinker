Few simple rules to keep us all in order:

1.  Please no excessive flaming, bashing, or trolling.
2.  Do not excessively copy and repaste other people's messages, especially to bypass someone who is being ignored.
3.  Do not log in under an admin's name if you are not one.
4.  Keep douche baggery to a minimum.
5.  Come message Firo, Agent 21, or another admin if something should be dealt with.  Provoking or calling out an admin is generally a BAD IDEA.
Breaking of any of these rules can result in a mute, and if repeated, and HENIOUS, can result in a possible ban/permanent ban.
